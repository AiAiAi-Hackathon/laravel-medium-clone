# Laravel Medium Clone

A Medium-like blogging platform built with Laravel 12, featuring article publishing, user authentication, and media
management.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- SQLite (default) or MySQL/PostgreSQL

## Setup Instructions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/laravel-medium-clone.git
   cd laravel-medium-clone
   ```

2. Install PHP dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Install JavaScript dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Build JavaScript dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Copy the environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

6. Generate application key:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

### Database Setup

The project is configured to use SQLite by default:

1. First, ensure your file has the correct database configuration: `.env`

```bash
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=/absolute/path/to/your/project/database/database.sqlite
```

**Note:** You can remove other DB_* variables (DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD) as they're not needed for
SQLite.

2. Create the SQLite database file:
   ```bash
   touch database/database.sqlite
   ```

3. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

4. (Optional) Seed the database with sample data:
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

If you want to start fresh at any point, you can use:

```bash
 php artisan migrate:fresh
```

This will drop all tables and re-run all migrations. Add `--seed` flag if you want to reseed the database:

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

### Running the Application

You can run the application using the custom dev script that starts the Laravel server, queue worker, and Vite
development server concurrently:

```bash
 composer dev
```

Or run each service separately:

1. Start the Laravel development server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

2. Start the queue worker:
   ```bash
   php artisan queue:listen
   ```

3. Compile assets with Vite:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application will be available at http://localhost:8000

### Testing

This project uses PestPHP for testing. To run the tests:

```bash
php artisan test
```

Or to run tests with Pest directly:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest
```
